### Features NOT INCLUDED (with more time...)
- Create React component as well
- Add a selector of Locations to allow the user to select more Locations (not only London)
- Improve the design
- Add more information about clouds, wind, etc...
- Even if that is responsive (i used float divs) it could be targeted with media queries and the mobile user experience could be improved.
- Initial Spinner meanwhile the app is doing the query to weather API
- Add the results to sessionStorage cache
